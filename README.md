This repository contains a collection of examples for the [Discord Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk).  To get started, visit [discord.dev](https://discord.dev).

### [Discord Activity Starter](discord-activity-starter)

This starter app will get you up and running quickly with the basic skeleton of an Embedded App using Node.js, React, and Vite.

### [SDK Playground](sdk-playground)

This example implements the SDK commands and events available within the application's iframe while building your app.

### [React Colyseus](react-colyseus)

This example uses Node.js, React, and [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/), a multiplayer JS framework, to demonstrate state management in a multiplayer experience.

### [Nested Messages](nested-messages)

This example implements an Embedded App using a nested framework like a game engine. When using a game engine, you need to send messages between a parent iframe and the nested framework.
